/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI
(Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height).
(mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs
3. Create a boolean variable containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4. Print a string to the console containing the variable
from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than
John's? true").

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

// // 1. Calculate the average score for each team

// Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw (the same average score)
// //
// // 4. EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored
// 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average winner
 // to the console. HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision. If you can't solve this one, just watch the solution, it's no problem :)
// // 5. Like before, change the scores to generate different
// winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.
